# MFAIMFG

This is the final project submitted to the course MFAIMFG: Computational Intelligence in Manufacturing Systems. This project uses artificial intelligence to classify vehicles entering a parking structure. It can issue different rates of parking fees depending if the vehicle is a car, a motorcycle, or a bicycle.
